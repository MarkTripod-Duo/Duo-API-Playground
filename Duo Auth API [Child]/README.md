This collection is designed to interact with the Duo Auth API. The Duo Auth API is a low-level, RESTful API for adding strong two-factor authentication to your website or application, and can be used to perform a variety of connectivity and authentication tests.

## üöÄ Getting started with this collection

1. **In the Duo Auth API [Child] collection**, go to the variables tab and enter the desired child account's name in the `child_account_name` variable field. This name must match exactly as it appears in the Duo Admin Panel. To confirm the correct account name, you can use the 'Retrieve Accounts' request in the Duo Accounts API collection, which provides a list of child accounts and their names.
2. **After populating `child_account_name`**, navigate to the Setup Child Account folder and execute the 'Deploy Auth API' request. This request creates an Admin API integration on the target account, and populates the request credentials automatically for use.
3. **Be sure to configure any necessary or optional parameters** for any particular request as specified in the Duo Admin API documentation. After setting up the environment variables and configuring parameters as needed, you're ready to utilize any request within the Duo Auth API [Child] collection.

## üí° Collection Note

The collection performs multiple functions.

- **Duo Auth API:** This request automates the deployment of the Auth API through a series of steps. Initially, it runs "Retrieve Accounts" to retrieve the list of child accounts and identifies the specific account ID by referencing the `child_account_name` variable. Subsequently, it creates the Auth API on the identified child account via "Create Integration" and obtains the secret key required for authentication via "Retrieve Secret Key." The script stores these values as both collection variables and in the `child_admin_api_matrix` for future use. In subsequent requests, it checks for existing entries in the matrix to determine if the Auth API [Child] already exists and updates the collection variables accordingly.
- **Clear Auth API Variables:** This request serves to clear the values of the collection variables related to the Admin API. It resets the `child_account_name`, `child_account_account_id`, `child_auth_api_ikey`, `child_auth_api_skey`, and `child_auth_api_host` variables to empty values. It's important to clear the variables to ensure requests are run on the correct account.

## üîç Variable Reference

Below is a list of variables defined within this collection. Some variables are dynamically generated during API interactions, while others need to be manually configured.

| Variable Name          | Description                                       | Scope  |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `child_auth_api_ikey`  | Your Accounts API Integration Key. This needs to be manually set in the global variables. | Global |
| `child_auth_api_skey`  | Your Accounts API Secret Key. This needs to be manually set in the global variables. | Global |
| `child_auth_api_host`  | Your Accounts API Hostname. This needs to be manually set in the global variables. | Global |
